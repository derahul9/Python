Tree represents the nodes connected by edges. It is a non-linear data structure. It has the following properties.

One node is marked as Root node.
Every node other than the root is associated with one parent node.
Each node can have an arbiatry number of child node.
We create a tree data structure in python by using the concept of node discussed earlier. We designate one node as root node and then add more nodes as child nodes.
