Classes allow reusability of data and functions
Method is a function associated with a class
Instance variables are unique to each instance. If the variables are common all across then they can be defined in the class itself
Create special init method inside the class. When we create methods inside a class, it receives the firt argument automatically which by convention is called "self".
The self argument helps to map an instance to other variables as seen, self.first, self.last etc. maps to emp_1.first, emp_1.last etc.
first, last, email, pay are all attributes of the class

The __init__ method is similar to constructors in C++ and Java. Constructors are used to initialize the objectâ€™s state. The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values)
to the data members of the class when an object of class is created. Like methods, a constructor also contains collection of statements(i.e. instructions) that are executed at
time of Object creation. It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. The method is useful to do any initialization you want to do with your object.

print (emp_1.fullname())
print (emp_2.fullname()) # Remember the use of self. When we call this, emp_2 is passed as an argument to the fullname method in the class. That is why we need self bydefault to
                         # avoid argument mismatch
print (Employee.fullname(emp_1)) # Another way of doing this is calling the class name.method name and passing the instance as a vriable

print (emp_1.__dict__) #Returns the value of emp_1 object as a dictionary
print (Employee.num_of_emps)
emp_1.apply_raise()
