PEP-8:
Coding standard for Python. Style item not compulsory (indendation, line length, white space, commenting, naming convention)
why? Helpful when there are different coders using the same style. Tools to do this - Pylint, Black, pycodestyle

Testing:
Pytest and Unitest (inbuilt by importing unitest)

CI-CD:
CI: Push small codes on a very frequent basis to the development branch. This will help to detect problem quickly.
CD: Continuous Delivery. Once approved in CI , code should be pushed to production.
Once the code is pushed into CI (eg. Travis CI, PEP-8 (Pylint, Black etc.) Testing kicks off that you've developed automatically
Different products that do that - Jenkins, Azure Pipeline, GitLab, Github action, Travis (Free and Easy for IaaC)
