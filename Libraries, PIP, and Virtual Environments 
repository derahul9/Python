You can import a library in python by -

import re
re.__file__ ( to check where python is opening the file from)
home/gituser/rahde/VENV/lib/python3.6/re.py (Its a single file so its a module, python tries to find the file in 
the location and reads it line by line until it fully loads it)

Module —> A single python file and package being directory of related python files

Whenever you import a file and try to use it, all your commands will be prefixed with re, eg. re.search()

eg. help(re.search) will show us how to use that functionality

We can also do —
from re import search, findall
(if you use it this way, when using it you just gonna do search instead of re.search)
