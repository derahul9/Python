Netconf uses XML. NX-API and other Devices have capability to give XML output.
Netconf has Restconf, NX-API has JSON mode then why do we need XML ? Because xml is still widely used
Libraries - xmltodict (convert xml to more like dictionary structure), lxml, element tree

Hierarchy to a xml data output. xml is tree like. It has a root node and then child nodes. child node will only have one root node to co-relate.
The tags are called elements which are under <> and there is a text field after that.

Video 2:
In python we are mostly using lxml or built in python library. We treat only tags/elements as nodes. Text is associated with nodes.
There could be also attributes for a tag/element which is also defined under <>

In the DOM (document object model), the XML formatting that we see in a browser, All of the below are considered as nodes:
Element nodes, Text nodes, Attribute nodes

Video 3:
If you see <jsr/>, it means you've opening tag for jsr as well as closing tag for jsr
Sibling node: Elements in the same level of hierarchy
Descendant node: Its like all child nodes are descendents of the very first node. Ancestor Node is opposite of descendant node

Video4:
xmltodict - converting xml to python dictionary (xml is basically series of tags with hierarchy in it)
xml to dict translation will be difficult.
